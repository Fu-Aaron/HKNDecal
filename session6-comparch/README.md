## Computer Architecture Lab

There are two versions of this lab; one built for Logisim and one as a Jupyter Notebook.

### Logisim

Relevant files are `demos and exercises.circ`, `solutions.circ`, and the `Logisim.app` folder.

### Jupyter Notebook

Use [nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link) to distribute this version of the lab. Here are some suggested presets:
 - JupyterHub URL: `https://eecs.datahub.berkeley.edu`
 - Git Repository URL: `https://github.com/HKNDecal/HKNDecal`
 - File to open: `session6-comparch/logic-circuits.ipynb`

With the above presets, here is the generated link: <https://eecs.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FHKNDecal%2FHKNDecal&urlpath=tree%2FHKNDecal%2Fsession6-comparch%2Flogic-circuits.ipynb&branch=master>
